# ProxyPool

A simple proxypool written in golang.  
[简体中文](./README-zhcn.md)

## Feature
- Get free proxy from network
- Automatic verification proxy
- Provide a web api for use
- Fast like lightning


## Build And Use
You must make sure your computer has installed golang.

```
cd source
git clone https://github.com/YHaoNan/ProxyPool.git
cd ProxyPool
go build
./HTTPProxyPool
```

After that, you can visit `http://localhost:4000` to get the proxylist.

## About
This project is only for learning golang. It's too crude for the production environment.

Have fun! xD
